I refactored all the pages so that the middle section will be scrollable on desktop when I add extra content, like this Now page, the Services page, and the Portfolio page.

The top and bottom icon bars weren't the same on all the pages, so I refactored all of them and made the index page a little better, I hope. I have not fully tested it on my iPhone yet since I've been having such a hard time with clearing the caches and getting the current css and file to load.

I pointed my domain at this site yesterday and am still finding lots of things I want to add or change. Today I added a Colophon to the _About Me__ page because I know some people will question my use of 1-bit icons and think I did it accidentally. I'm still struggling with browser caching when I'm updating content and CSS often. This isn't meant to be a blog, but I needed to get it out of my system.

The past month I've been deep down a rabbit hole with two of my vintage Machintosh computers. I have a iBook G3 "clamshell" laptop and an iMac G4 "lamp" computer that I've been trying to upgrade to the last operating system they would support


In both instances OS X 10.4.11 Tiger was the last release for both of these computers. They're among the last to be capable of booting into either Mac OS 9 or OS X Tiger, which makes them kind of useful if you like playing around with both the new and classic OSes.


Once I got both of them running I starting playing around with HyperCard again. It was just a delightful program that let you create all kinds database-type "stacks". The scripting language that was built into it was the inspiration for HTML and the Wide World Web.


It led me to the creation of this site first as a proof-of-concept to see if I could style a small windowed website with the look and feel of Classic Mac OS and HyperCard.


I'm nearly ready to push it live and point my web address to it thus Christening it formally as my personal site for blatant self promotion.
