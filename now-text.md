Finding usable versions of old bitmapped fonts on websites is very hard. I've found a few of the original early Mac OS System 1.0â€“7.0 fonts, but there's a couple out there I'd still like to track down.

There was a new font exclusively used on the Newton called Espy I'd like to get my hands on, but I can find it. And converting from old formats to new ones is especially difficult.

I'm fleshing out additional desktop icons for this site. I won't push them all to the production version until I'm certain I have the app icons I like and that they're positioned nicely. 


I have a couple simple animations in mind for the Macintosh HD icon, Clarus the DogCow, and the Trash can. I won't do anything to the HyperCard icon, but might do something to the Risk and Photoshop app icons.


I played Risk for a few minutes today and it was fun. The patterns used to tell the different players' countries appart were hard to see at such a small size since the 512px window is very small on a modern Mac.
