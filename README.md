I fell down a rabbit hole during Mastodon's #MARCHINTOSH when I decided to boot up a couple old Macs I had mostly on display. The iMac G4 needed a keyboard and mouse as well as a software update to OS X 10.4 Tiger.

Long story short, I got the iMac G4 and an iBook G4 up and running with the last software upgrade available to those machines. They're both capable of running Mac OS 9 as a dual boot or in emulation. 

So I started playing around with HyperCard again. I first thought about creating a resume HyperCard Stack and embed it in a Google Sites website I use. Then I decided that that wasn't working the way I wanted, so I started coding.

After four days of pretty solid work, I was ready to point my domain at this new site hosted here on GitHub.

Backstory: I have adored the 1-bit Susan Kare icons since I first saw a Macintosh in 1985 and bought one in 1989. In recent years I have recreated a lot of them as vector files. They're still 1-bit square but as vectors, they scale up and down perfectly and don't dither.

So the 1-bit icons I'm using on my site are .SVGs. All my windows and popup dialogs have the classic striped title bar. I have one on the contact page confirmation dialog that is the dappled or dithered modal style, but the rest are Mac OS 6 and before stripes.

The Chicago font I'm using is Sysfont. I'm using the Google font Montserrat a lot for text. I really like how it is "opinionated" for a sans serif font and it has a lot of weights. I have started to lean a lot towards light weights (300) for text.

I could've used Geneva like HyperCard and classic Mac OS, but I didn't. I might revisit that, but honestly that's the one break I'm making from my theme because I like the readability at small pts.
