I'm currently prototyping new layouts for my site, especially focused on making the HyperCard-style interface feel authentic on mobile.

Finding usable versions of old bitmapped fonts on websites is very hard. I've found a few of the original early Mac OS System 1.0â€“7.0 fonts, but there's a couple out there I'd still like to track down.

There was a new font exclusively used on the Newton called Espy I'd like to get my hands on, but I can find it. And converting from old formats to new ones is especially difficult.
