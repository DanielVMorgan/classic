This site was designed to evoke the look and feel of Classic Mac OS System 1.0 through 7.0 and HyperCard when the graphics were 1-bit black and white pixels.

Most of the navigation icons—the pointing hands, home button, mail button, category icons—are vector recreations that will always appear as 1-bit icons at any size.

The fonts are converted from the original bitmap system fonts into modern TrueType (.ttf) fonts and web-optiized .woff and .woff2 file types.

This project wouldn't have been possible without a large community of retro Macintosh enthusiasts freely sharing their discoveries, workflows, and files. Here's a non-comprehensive list.
