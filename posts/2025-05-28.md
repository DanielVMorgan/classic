I took a  break from adding any new pages or Easter Eggs to this site and have been working on a family recipe book on and off in my free time. This is a project I started quite a while ago to gather recipes our mom had and then additional ones from my siblings to create a recipe book for future generations of my family. There are eight of us siblings and many of them are grandparents. My children are the youngest of that generation and did get to know my parents well, thankfully.

I need to work on the Google Site I have set up for the three projects that are interrelated to the recipe bookâ€”family tree, photo scanning, and the recipe book. I hope to plug away at each project as time allows with big bursts in the winter when I'm it is too nasty to hike. I registered a domain for it a few weeks ago, but need to flesh out the site better. 

I chose Google Sites for that project simply because of how it integrates Google Drive so well. I may even leverage Google Photos to share jpegs of the scans.
