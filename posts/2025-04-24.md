I have been rethinking and revising the services I will promote as well as icons and page to display them. Most people don't need business cards and conventional branding, but with the move to digital marketing a properly drawn logo and now avatar are important.

During this revision, I was unhappy with the detailed icons I had created that represent the services. They were too detailed and didn't really look great at 48 pixels tall. I decided to do some deep historical research of old 1-bit Mac application and document icons using Infinity Mac. 

I'm using (stealing?) the vintage PDF document icon and the MacDraw one for my PDF forms and flyers offerings, respectively. For revamped Branding services, I found the classic Aldus PageMaker document icon and modified it with a capital "D", for Dan. I grabbed a 18 pt (1-bit) Palatino font screenshot and recreated it.

Finally I split Software and Website Design into two separate offerings because they're really different markets with different requirements and pricing tiers. I'm leveraging the MacDraft icon for the Software UX Design and a newly creating icon for Website Design. I need to fully flesh out the summaries and put some PDFs behind the document icons as well.
