I added *Phase Breakdown and Deliverables* pages for each service, accessible, but clicking the icon or text of the service. Each document is a PDF framed by a border and upper right hand page "dog ear" like the generic document icon from classic Mac OS icons.

Late in the process I added a bit of red color to the two headings, in homage to the late '80s Apple documentation books, like the [Human Interface Guide](https://archive.org/details/applehumaninterf00appl/page/136/mode/2up). Turns out that was a very specific red, linked to the original six color apple.
