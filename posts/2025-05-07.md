I have been adding working menus below several of the menu bar menus. I got the triple-flash confirmation working pretty well too (for when the user chooses a menu item.)

Today I worked on recreating the "About This Macintosh..." modal. I got real picky about the details and went as far as cracking open the System File in a System 7 emulator with ResEdit to find a real Macintosh Portable icon. I wanted that to represent my MacBook Pro in the About dialog.

Finally, and just a few minutes ago, I added a real scroll bar to the window that looks and works just like classic System 7.
