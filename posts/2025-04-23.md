I have been rethinking and revising the services I will promote as well as icons and page to display them. Most people don't need business cards and conventional branding, but with the move to digital marketing a properly drawn logo and now avatar are important.

During this revision, I was unhappy with the detailed icons I had created that represent the services. They were too detailed and didn't really look great at 48 pixels tall. I decided to do some deep historical research of old 1-bit Mac application and document icons using Infinity Mac. 

I'm using (stealing?) the vintage PDF document icon and the MacDraw one for my PDF forms and flyers offerings, respectively. For my website and software design services, I went back to the original MacWrite icon and turned the "page" (rotated square) black and then used white pixels to simulate tabbed lines of code.

Finally for my revamped Branding services, I found the classic Aldus PageMaker document icon and modified it with a capital "D", for Dan. I grabbed a 18 pt (1-bit) Palatino font screenshot and recreated it.
