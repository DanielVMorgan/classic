I'm fleshing out additional desktop icons for this site. I won't push them all to the production version until I'm certain I have the app icons I like and that they're positioned nicely. 


I have a couple simple animations in mind for the Macintosh HD icon, Clarus the DogCow, and the Trash can. I won't do anything to the HyperCard icon, but might do something to the Risk and Photoshop app icons.


I played Risk for a few minutes today and it was fun. The patterns used to tell the different players' countries appart were hard to see at such a small size since the 512px window is very small on a modern Mac.
