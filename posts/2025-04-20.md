I have been beating my head against a wall for the past two days to figure out a way to post these little blog entries on my website. I wanted something that I controlled, either within my GitHub repo or on my local machine. 

I have settled on what you see here—mostly html, css, and some js—no blogging "engine" or outside libraries or dependencies to fret over. I probably have to do a little more on my end. I can't just open a browser window or app and post something quickly. I have to create a Markdown document, add a bit of json to a file with the file name of the new post, and then push everything to GitHub.

I like the simplicity of what you're seeing. No theme, for one. I just want text in a frame in my personal site and not a external blog somewhere else.
