I pointed my domain at this site yesterday and am still finding lots of things I want to add or change. Today I added a Colophon to the _About Me__ page because I know some people will question my use of 1-bit icons and think I did it accidentally. I'm still struggling with browser caching when I'm updating content and CSS often. This isn't meant to be a blog, but I needed to get it out of my system.
