I organized my past work on my 1-bit icon vectors this morning and stumbled across the Space Invader sprites I created a while back. 

Now I’m building a little Easter egg that pops up and over the main window. There’s several rows of sprites that animate. I hope to push it to all my pages sometime soon.
