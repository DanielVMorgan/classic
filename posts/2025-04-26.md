I restarted Zelda TOTK over the last couple days and have been playing slowly in some free moments while listening to podcasts.

On the coding front, I reworked the top menu bar menus today. I added all the pages below the Home menu so that each web page has a link there.

Then this evening, I took that code repurposed it under a new Services menu. Each one of my services has a menu item there and opens the PDF in a modal. It looks and works pretty slick. I'll push it to production after I save this post.
