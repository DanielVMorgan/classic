I organized my past work on my 1-bit icon vectors this morning and stumbled across the Space Invader sprites I created a while back. So, I created a little Easter egg that is triggered when someone clicks or taps on the Apple logo in the menubar. 

I also took the time to break out all the duplicate code across the pages and componentize it in separate html and js files. It has simplified the maintaining of that code, but now I have to test using a local server built into VS Code.
